Photography Portfolio — Local Site
----------------------------------
Files created under /pages, /styles, /js, /images.

How to use:
- Open pages/index.html in a browser (file://.../pages/index.html)
- All CSS/JS paths are relative; site works locally.
- Replace images in /images with your own photographs. Keep filenames if you want to keep layout.

Notes:
- Gallery uses 20 film-like placeholders (print1.jpeg ... print20.jpeg).
- Fonts are requested from Google Fonts (requires internet) but layout works offline.
